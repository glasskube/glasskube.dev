Today, we are happy to announce that Distr now includes a built-in private OCI-compliant [artifact registry](https://distr.sh/docs/product/registry/).

Manage and distribute container images, Helm charts, and other OCI artifacts with license-based access control, audit logs, and a visual UI that makes self-managed software distribution pretty darn simple if we do say so ourselves, built for both you and your customers.

## Why we built a registry into Distr

Early users of Distr appreciated having control over which versions of their software customers could access.
But it didn’t take long for a pattern to emerge, users started asking for the same kind of control over their container images and artifacts.

Some described workarounds they were using with third-party registries, but none offered the ability to restrict access by tag or version.
Others mentioned how hard it was to get visibility into which customers were downloading what, and when.

We realized this wasn’t just a feature request, it was a gap in the ecosystem.
And that’s why we bumped up the development priority of the OCI-compliant artifact registry that is now available for you to try today.

## Real-world pain, solved.

In case you are unsure whether this is a feature you need, consider this.

Let’s say a new customer is ready to deploy your self-managed solution.
Contracts signed.
Excitement is high.
But then you get a flurry of messages from your end customers along the lines of…

> "We can't access your registry."  
> "Is our firewall blocking the pull?"  
> "Which version are we supposed to use?"

Sound familiar?

Vendors often don’t have a standard way to set up credentials, provide pull instructions, and troubleshoot artifact access issues.
Customers get frustrated.
Deployment stalls.

With Distr's built-in registry, those problems go away.

## Meet the Distr Artifact Registry

Built for software vendors who serve end-customer with different [deployment appetites](https://distr.sh/docs/use-cases/fully-self-managed/), our registry brings OCI-compliant artifact distribution natively integrated into Distr.

Here are a few of its key features:

### OCI-compliant & format-flexible

The registry supports any OCI artifact, including:

- Docker images
- Helm charts
- WASM modules
- Anything else that follows the OCI spec

### License-based access control

Vendors can restrict access by using Artifacts licenses. Grant or revoke permissions to one or many artifacts at the tag level. Update instantly when entitlements change.

### Visual management

Use any OCI compliant CLI for pushing and pulling, and use the Distr Registry UI to:

- View artifact versions or tags
- See which customer pulled what, and when
- Track deployment status across environments

/>

The downloads page gives granular artifact consumption logs

## What's next for the Registry?

We’re just getting started, here’s what’s coming soon:

- Integrated CVE scanning for registry artifacts
- Advanced usage metrics
- Audit log export
- SBOM support

## Give it a try today

Several organizations are already using the registry in production, some even with custom domains, so their end users interact with a fully branded portal without ever seeing Distr.

The registry is available now in all Distr accounts. Just head to the Artifacts tab in the dashboard to [get started](https://distr.sh/docs/guides/container-registry/).

- Read the [docs](https://distr.sh/docs/product/registry/)
- Contact us for a [demo](https://cal.glasskube.com/team/gk/demo)

We are excited to hear your thoughts on the registry and open to your feedback to further shape the product to make it as useful as possible for vendors and end-customers alike.
