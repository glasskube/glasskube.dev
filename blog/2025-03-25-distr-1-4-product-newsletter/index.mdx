# Distr v1.4 is Live!

Hey there! We listened to your feedback, and we're back with a massive new feature.

This one was inspired by some interesting insights into the real-world use cases a considerable amount of vendors told us they were up against, and it's why we're shipping **v1.4** today. It’s a minor version bump, but it unlocks new possibilities for advanced self-managed distribution. 

<!-- truncate -->

Each vendor use case we come across is different, so with **v1.4** we aim to give software vendors even more control over **what** they ship and **how** they ship it.

Want a hint? It’s all about **artifacts**, and a whole new way to manage them.

## 🚀 What's New: Distr’s Built-in OCI Artifact Registry (Beta)

We are rolling out the **beta version of the Distr OCI Registry**. Initially enabling the feature to users who specifically asked for it, but if you’re interested, just let us know, and we’ll unlock it for you.

### Why it matters 
Self-managed deployments often require strict control over what software gets deployed, where, and by whom. That’s where Distr’s new **OCI Artifact Registry** comes in.

With the Distr OCI registry, software vendors can now publish and distribute not just container images, but also **Helm charts, SBOMs, policy modules**, and other **OCI-compliant artifacts**, all managed natively within your Distr account.

### This means software vendors get

- ✅ **Granular access control**: Define exactly which customer can pull which artifacts and versions  
- 🧩 **Multi-artifact support**: Distribute Helm charts, images, config bundles, and any artifact that is OCI-compliant  
- 🔐 **Software supply chain security**: Store SBOMs and signatures for safer distribution  
- 📊 **Visibility**: Track where, how, and by whom artifacts are consumed  
- 📦 **Open standards**: Built on the OCI spec and compatible with existing tooling (Docker, ORAS, etc.)

  }}
/>

Whether you're distributing a single binary or an entire application stack, the new registry gives you the building blocks to do it **securely**, **reliably**, and in an **OCI-compliant** way, inside your end-customers’ networks.
