When Isaac Newton's famously stated, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants," he was obviously speaking in reference to his scientific endeavors, but the centuries old statement is equally applicable to modern day software. Those giants are the developers who came before us, and their shoulders are the artifacts, packages, and libraries we rely on every day to build and ship our products.

But that foundation only holds if those artifacts are secure, portable, and compatible across environments. Great code isn't of much use if it's fragile, locked into a specific environment, or can't move freely between systems.

That's where image format and distribution standardization comes in, hugely impacting how software artifacts are stored, secured and distributed nowadays. Modern container registries, backed by the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/), have been growing in popularity in the last few years and rightly so, they give us a shared foundation for packaging and distributing artifacts. They unlock portability across clouds, clusters, and even air-gapped environments.

<!-- truncate -->

But not all OCI registries serve the same purpose. Some are designed primarily for **internal use** - supporting developers, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment within a single organization. Others are built for **external distribution** - helping software vendors distribute artifacts to customers, often across security boundaries or into air-gapped environments.

In this post, we'll compare different registry options, focusing on how each supports real-world software distribution needs. We'll explore which registries excel at internal workflows versus external distribution, with special attention to OCI compliance, the standard that ensures your artifacts work consistently across environments.

But first, let's define a few key terms.

## Terminology:

-   **Registry**: A service for storing and distributing container artifacts. Examples include private Docker image registries, OCI registries and many proprietary registries which will be covered below.
-   **Project:** In the context of registries it's sometimes used as a logical grouping of container image or artifact repositories.
-   **Repository**: A logical grouping of artifacts within a registry, often organized by format or purpose.
-   **Artifact**: Any stored item, binaries, config files, packages, policies, OCI images, etc.
-   **Container Image**: A type of artifact built from blobs and a manifest, typically used to run containers.
-   **Blob**: A registry-specific term for a layer within a container image.
-   **Manifest**: Metadata that defines how blobs are combined to form a container image. 
-   **Package**: A language-specific artifact format (e.g., Python wheels, npm modules). 
-   **Monorepo Registry**: A registry where all artifacts live in a single logical space. 
-   **Security Supply Chain Artifacts**: SBOMs, image signatures, and other integrity-related metadata.
-   **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: A list of components and dependencies used in a software build.
-   **Image Signing**: A cryptographic process that ensures the integrity and authenticity of container images.
-   **OCI Compliance**: Adherence to the Open Container Initiative standards, ensuring OCI-compliant containers can be used across different platforms.
    

## What Is a Container Registry?

Traditionally, container registries stored ready-to-run images. But today's more highly integrated and complex workflows demand more. Developers also store supporting artifacts like Terraform modules, SBOMs, and image signatures, making flexible registries critical to the entire supply chain.

Modern registries have evolved, largely in part thanks to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) to support these use cases, becoming general-purpose artifact hubs. That's why in this post, we're expanding the scope beyond just container images.

## Let's Talk Artifact Formats

Docker images are still everywhere, but the rise of the [OCI specifications](https://github.com/opencontainers) (heavily influenced by Docker's image and runtime specification) has opened the door to more flexible artifact definitions. Docker images are by default OCI-compatible, so you don't have to switch formats to gain portability. But OCI also supports a much broader range of artifact types, including:

-   **Generic Artifacts**: Any unstructured file or binary  
-   **OCI Artifacts**: Anything following the OCI spec 
-   **JSON / CSV**: Common data formats
-   **Language-Specific Formats**:
    -   **Conan** (C/C++)
    -   **Python** (.py, .whl)
    -   **Maven** (Java)
    -   **Apt** (Debian)
    -   **NPM** (Node.js)
    -   **Go** (Go modules)
    -   **Yum** (RPM)
    

## Understanding the OCI Format
Based on the original Docker runtime and image format, the Open Container Initiative stepped in to standardize these into the more open and widely available OCI Image, Distribution, and Runtime specifications. Bringing consistency and portability to container images. Now, it's doing the same for other types of artifacts.

Popular tools like Helm, Docker, and ORAS support pushing and pulling OCI artifacts. An interesting trend that's emerged is that even non-OCI-native formats like Kubeflow pipelines or ML models can be wrapped as OCI artifacts and stored in registries.

Think of it like a general grocery bag: it doesn't matter what you put inside, as long as it fits the format, it can be stored, versioned, and distributed reliably.

## Key Considerations when choosing a registry

When evaluating registries, consider these core criteria:

**Internal vs. External Use**  
Is this for your development team's workflow, or for distributing to customers? This is the most fundamental distinction.

**OCI Compliance Level**  
How completely does the registry implement the OCI specification? This affects which artifact types you can store and distribute.

**Security & Access Controls**  
For internal use, integration with your existing IAM may be sufficient. For external distribution, you'll need granular controls over which artifacts are visible to which customers.

**Deployment Flexibility**  
Can the registry deploy where you need it - cloud, on-prem, or air-gapped environments?

> In this post, we'll focus primarily on the OCI-compatible capabilities of the registries we're comparing.

## The building blocks of an Artifact registry

When you look at the registry services out on market today, every registry is built from some combination of the following core components:

![generic-diagram](/img/blog/2025-04-07-registry-comparison/generic-diagram.png)
  
-   Registries can act as **monorepos**, where all artifacts live in a single logical space.
-   If they're **multi-repo**, registries are often organized into **projects** or **namespaces**.
-   Repositories can be configured as **public** or **private** depending on the use case.
-   All registries support some form of **user authentication**, and a few extend that access control down to individual artifacts, or even specific version tags.
-   How repositories are structured varies between providers. Some support **multiple artifact groupings**, for example, by language-specific formats, by application, or into OCI-specific repositories. Others offer more generic repositories that work as a catch-all.
-   **Clients** are used to interface with the registry. Most registries support common tools like the Docker CLI, Helm CLI, and ORAS.
    
Each registry we'll look at has its own configuration of these building blocks, plus platform-specific features that support different workflows.

> In our comparison, we'll focus on OCI-compliant capabilities and provide a clear breakdown of key differences to help you find the right fit for your use case.

## Detailed Comparisons of Popular OCI Registries

## Internal Registries

Internal registries are for the most part built for trusted, in-house use. They integrate tightly with cloud services, IAM systems, and CI/CD pipelines to support internal teams. Their strengths lie in automation, visibility, and secure artifact sharing within the same organization, not so much for external distribution.

Most offer OCI compliance, access controls, and vulnerability scanning. They're ideal when dev and deploy happen inside the same security boundary, with no need to serve external customers.

If you need cloud-native integration and efficient artifact workflows within your org, internal registries are a solid fit.

## External Registries: The Distribution Challenge

External registries face a fundamentally different challenge: distributing software to end-customers, usually outside of your organization. That shift requires a different focus: access control, auditing, version visibility, and compliance.

While GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub are excellent for open-source and low-security use cases, they're not well suited for commercial software distribution because they lack:

- **Granular access control**: No way to give specific customers access to specific artifact versions
- **Air-gapped support**: Limited options for distributing to high-security environments
- **Usage visibility**: Missing audit logs and download tracking that commercial vendors need
- **License management**: No built-in capabilities to manage software entitlements

This is where purpose-built external registries like Distr come in, addressing these gaps for vendor-to-customer distribution.

## Distr: The OCI Registry Built for Modern On-Prem Deployments

![Distr OCI registry](/img/blog/2025-04-07-registry-comparison/distr-cr.png)

[Distr](https://distr.sh/) is an external registry which is technically a "monorepo" today, but that's by design. Unlike other registries that try to group artifacts by application within the registry itself (like JFrog), Distr handles the application layer separately. 

The Distr platform includes built-in support for Helm charts and Docker Compose files, so full applications can live outside the registry while still being tightly connected. 

Our focus isn't just artifact storage, it's solving the real challenges software vendors face when distributing software to end customers. Even in its v1, Distr's OCI registry delivers on that with features like usage metrics, ORAS integration, and a model that's built around real-world distribution needs rather than internal ops workflows.

![Distr-diagram](/img/blog/2025-04-07-registry-comparison/distr-diagram.png)

**Key features:**

-   Only supports OCI formatted and OCI-compliant artifacts (Helm, Docker, etc)
-   Built on OCI v2.0
-   Built specifically for on-prem deployment scenarios
-   Advanced features: artifact tag filtering, usage tracking, granular access controls
-   SaaS or Self Hosted deployment option on the air-gapped case
-   Massively Scalable: supporting S3 and S3 alternative object storage services.
    
**Upcoming features:**

-   Security Scanning  
-   SBOM generation and image signature tracking 

**Who it's for:**

Built for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), B2B platforms, and enterprise software teams who need to distribute commercial software to customer environments, especially air-gapped, self-managed, or regulated deployments.

- **On-prem, customer-facing distribution**:  
  **Distr** is built for software vendors distributing artifacts to external customer environments, including regulated, self-managed, or air-gapped deployments. It offers granular access controls, usage tracking, and flexible deployment models that internal or public registries can't deliver.
- **Best for open source projects**:  
  **GitHub Container Registry** and **Docker Hub** are ideal for distributing public artifacts to a wide audience with minimal setup. They're easy to adopt, work well with standard dev tooling, and are suited for low-security, high-discoverability use cases.
- **Tight GitLab integration**:  
  For teams using GitLab for source control and CI/CD, the **GitLab Container Registry** keeps your pipelines and packages in one place with minimal friction.
- **Minimal, self-hosted setup**:  
  If you need a lightweight, all-in-one option, **Gitea** offers basic registry support alongside its Git hosting features, great for small teams and internal tools.


## Conclusion

Choosing the right registry requires first understanding your distribution challenge:

- **Internal registries** like JFrog, Harbor, and cloud provider options excel at workflow integration, developer experience, and automated pipelines within a single organization.

- **External registries** vary significantly in capability. Public options like Docker Hub and GitHub CR work for open-source distribution but fall short for commercial software vendors who need control, visibility, and security.

For software vendors distributing to external customers, particularly in regulated, on-premise, or air-gapped environments, purpose-built solutions like Distr fill critical gaps that general-purpose registries don't.

The right registry won't just store your artifacts. It'll move your software forward, wherever it needs to go.
