I am Jakob—an engineer working at Glasskube, which helps software and ai companies distribute their applications to self-managed environments.
We build an Open Source Software Distribution platform called Distr ([`github.com/glasskube/distr`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr)).

If you've ever thought that **Docker Compose** is too basic for your deployment needs, but a full **Kubernetes** setup feels like overkill, you're definitely not alone.

Luckily, Docker has come up with a solution just for this: **Docker Swarm**.
This tool lets you connect multiple Docker daemons to create a **Swarm cluster**, giving you access to distributed computing features.
With Docker Swarm, you get benefits like scheduling, better availability, and many of the advantages that come with cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes.

On top of that, Docker Stacks make it easy to deploy almost any **Compose file** to your Swarm cluster.
This means you can take advantage of a distributed deployment infrastructure while keeping your application manifest straightforward and easy to manage.

Given all these benefits, it’s no surprise that Docker Swarm support was one of our most requested features.
Today, we’re excited to announce that **Docker Swarm support has officially landed in Distr!**

To enable Docker Swarm support, the steps are simple.
First, you need to be signed in to Distr.
If you don't have an account yet, you can just <Link to={signupLink()}>sign up for free</Link>.
After [enabling Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/), all you need to do is to check the box labeled “Swarm mode” when adding a deployment, and you’re good to go!
Keep in mind that you currently can’t enable or disable Swarm mode for existing deployments due to some limitations in the underlying Docker system.

Once Swarm mode is turned on, the **Distr Docker Agent** will use the **Docker Stack API** to deploy your application’s Compose file.
It will also use the **Docker Service API** to monitor your application’s health metrics and log streams (coming soon).

Have you tried out the new Docker Swarm mode in Distr yet?
We’d love to hear your thoughts, as we’re on a mission to create the best application distribution solution possible!

This enhancement was made possible thanks to collaboration with GitHub user **[Asher Abecasiss](https://github.com/asherAbecasiss)**,
who led this initiative and provided our very first community contribution.

We appreciate the support and feedback from our community, which helps us keep improving!
