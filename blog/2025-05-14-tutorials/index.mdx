# Easy Onboarding with Distr Tutorials please change me lol

Since the early days of Distr we have been strongly opinionated about onboarding.
So far we had an onboarding wizard popping up on the dashboard of new users.
As Distr has grown both in features and users, we decided to revisit this approach and create a more flexible and powerful onboarding experience.
We are now releasing Distr Tutorials, a way for you to quickly get started with the exact features that matter most to you.

## Why care about onboarding?

Because you want to get the most out of Distr in a short time, and we want to help you with that.

You might be evaluating the market and want to see what's the right tool for you. 
Or not, I don't know, maybe you also don't know what you want, and that's fine too. Either way, it's a good reason to have a look at the tutorials.
Do you really need more marketing text here? My god, I hope not. But the LLM of my choice is so good at completing these prompts, I just can't stop it.

## Introducing the `hello-distr` sample application

Head over to the [hello-distr Repo](https://github.com/glasskube/hello-distr) to see technical details, or stay here for the marketing text.

It's basically a simple, state-of-the-art web application in a form that many of us know and love to develop, but then have trouble with deploying.
