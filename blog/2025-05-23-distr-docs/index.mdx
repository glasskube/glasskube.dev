import DefaultCTA from '@site/src/components/cta/DefaultCTA/defaultCTA';

I am Philip—an engineer working at Glasskube, which helps software and AI companies distribute their applications to self-managed environments.
We build an Open Source Software Distribution platform called Distr ([`github.com/glasskube/distr`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr)).

We previously built all our technical documentation - including this website - with Docusaurus.
We generally liked using a static page generator and having all content fully Open Source on GitHub, so everyone can create a pull request
if they find a typo or want to improve our docs.
You can check out the source code of this exact website at [`github.com/glasskube/glasskube.dev`](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube.dev).

Although Docusaurus did its job quite well, we decided to use Starlight ([starlight.astro.build](https://starlight.astro.build/))
which is built on top of Astro ([astro.build](https://astro.build/)) for our Distr docs.
After working with both frameworks, I am able to summarize the differences and point to the biggest distinctions.

There are many other popular open source frameworks for building great documentation and even more static site renderers (SSR),
which can be customized to serve documentation.

Choosing Starlight was to some extent a gut decision, and we are only able to compare Astro to Docusaurus.

Another alternative worth mentioning would have been MkDocs ([mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/)),
especially [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) looks great.

## Docusaurus vs. Starlight - What to look at?

:::info
Both Docusaurus and Starlight are built on top of existing web frameworks.
While Docusaurus is built upon React, Starlight is based upon Astro, but can be used with multiple different web frameworks.
:::

When evaluating a static site renderer for our documentation, in hindsight, I would look at the following criteria:

- **Design**: A great documentation framework looks great and modern out of the box but can still be easily customized to look unique.
- **SEO**: All required SEO features (description, sitemaps, page structures) should be available and configurable out of the box.
- **DevEx**: Developer experience should be great.
  Build times and reloads should be fast, and there shouldn't be an endless amount of third-party dependencies to get started.
- **Extensibility:** It should be possible to also create marketing pages with the same framework.

### Docusaurus vs. Starlight: Design

Docusaurus and Starlight have made quite different decisions regarding design.

Docusaurus uses Infima ([infima.dev](https://infima.dev/)) at its core.
It is actually pretty tightly coupled, so if you want to style specific pages or use CSS classes to style some components, you need to get familiar with Infima.
Sadly, Infima itself isn't that mature yet and misses a lot of components and possibilities that frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind are offering.

Also, integrating Bootstrap or Tailwind is not really possible.

Starlight and Astro, on the other hand, don't come with a specific CSS framework built in, but provide a one-line command with their CLI to integrate Tailwind.

Read more about [Starlight and Tailwind](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/).

:::note
It took a little until Starlight fully supported Tailwind v4.
But once [#2862](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/2862) was completed,
upgrading Starlight from Tailwind v3 to v4 worked very well and was pretty well documented.
:::

### Docusaurus vs. Starlight: SEO

Both frameworks provide all the necessary features to configure the needed meta data tags out of the box.
You can read the [SEO guide for Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/seo) or check out all the
[SEO Integrations for Astro](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=performance%2Bseo)
which come preconfigured with Starlight.

As both frameworks support static rendering at build time, page speed is lightning fast and is only slowed down
by external libraries that are integrated.

| Feature                          | Docusaurus                  | Starlight |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Sitemap generation               | ✅                          | ✅        |
| Metadata & Open Graph            | ✅                          | ✅        |
| Broken Link Checker              | ✅                          | ✅        |
| Image Optimization & compression | ⚠️ (hard to get it working) | ✅        |

It should be noted that most features for Starlight are available via plugins.

:::tip
It is generally recommended to run your documentation through Google's [PageSpeed Insights Test](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

### Docusaurus vs. Starlight: Developer experience

A framework for writing documentation should not hold you back from writing documentation quickly:

- It should not be a lot of effort to keep up to date.
- It should be fast, blazing fast.
- It should have great integrations, documentation, and community support.
- It should feel modern and fun to use.

#### Maintenance work

Docusaurus' hard dependency on React introduces a natural update hurdle.
Although React, Docusaurus, and Infima are all Open Source projects from Meta (formerly Facebook), they are developed by different teams.
Not only does the Docusaurus team test compatibility with the latest React version, but also all plugins need to ensure compatibility.
Only after the core team and all plugins support the latest version of React can you safely upgrade your Docusaurus version.

Starlight, on the other hand, only depends on Astro, which is the same team building Starlight, which doesn't seem to require the same amount of effort to keep up to date.
It also has fewer moving parts.

#### Speed

To be completely honest: The reason I looked for another documentation framework was that I was fed up with Docusaurus taking forever to start the initial development server.
With the latest Node version (24), Docusaurus version (3.7), and React version (19), it took a little over 5 seconds to start the development server.
Although this number doesn't seem to be that high, it was a lot higher with previous versions.
I remember waiting over 20 seconds for the development server to start, which _really_ frustrated me.

Starlight, on the other hand, starts the development server in less than half the time Docusaurus takes.
The biggest difference is that the Astro compiler [`github.com/withastro/compiler`](https://github.com/withastro/compiler) is written in Go instead of using JavaScript to build the website bundle.

#### Integrations

The only integration that is still missing and not available for Starlight is a Mermaid integration.
Although Mermaid support ([#1259](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/1259)) is the second most requested feature after multiple sidebars
([#959](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/959)), there is no official statement if it is on the roadmap.
Currently, there is only a workaround with rendering Mermaid charts with Playwright.

#### Feeling

Starlight and Astro also felt more fun to use.
Their CLI has nice animations, everything just looks a little bit more modern.

### Docusaurus vs. Starlight: Extensibility

Although the Starlight plugin system is pretty extensive, the React ecosystem is really infinite, and there are a lot of plugins available for React that can be used with Docusaurus.

Here comes the catch: if you _really_ want to, you can also use React components in Starlight and access the same plugin ecosystem.

## Writing a technical documentation - What is important?

- Structure
- Focus on the most viewed pages
- Writing style
- Visuals

### Technical documentation structure

Distr isn't built for just one type of scenario.
So rather than simply documenting features, we structured our content to first introduce core conceptual aspects relating to self-managed deployments and Distr more generally.
From there, we connect these foundational concepts directly to practical use cases.
Only after this groundwork is laid do we guide users toward more detailed product specifications and technical guides.

New users typically start their journey in our **Getting Started** section. Here, we address questions such as "What exactly is Distr?", "Who is it built for?" and "What can Distr do?".

Afterwards users are prompted to move on to the **Use Cases** section. Ideally, this is the stage where users identify scenarios similar to their own deployment challenges.

![](/img/blog/2025-05-23-distr-docs/3744fe91-c12d-470e-affe-537d59748ee3.png)

Only then do we guide the user to the detailed technical insights and precise implementation instructions found in the **Guides and Product** sections.

Additionally, we offer complementary documentation for self-hosting Distr itself.
Oh, and in case you were wondering: Yes, you can actually use Distr to self-host Distr!
We also provide detailed resources on integrations, including how to leverage our API and SDK, as well as guides covering automation and authentication topics.

### Focusing on the most viewed pages

Planning how your documentation should ideally be consumed is one thing, but understanding how it actually plays out in reality is another.
By leveraging PostHog to monitor our documentation's usage metrics, we've observed something encouraging.

Posthog confirms that our structured approach aligns closely with actual user behavior.
The analytics clearly show that users typically start by grasping fundamental concepts in the **Getting Started** section,
then explore specific scenarios in the **Use Cases** section, and finally dive into detailed product specifications and guides.

### Writing style for technical documentation

Let's be honest, nobody spends their weekends curled up with documentation and a cup of warm cocoa.
Good documentation doesn't need poetic or elaborate prose, it just has to be clear, concise and intuitively skim-able.
When we write docs we really try to remove unnecessary fluff and filler words and not be overly verbose.

Every sentence should be in service to the users ability to quickly understand what your product does and most importantly, how does is solve the users specific problems.
Fighting to retain attention is tough for any medium, but documentation writers have it the hardest, since this is the prevailing sentiment they are up again.

Making an effort to be clear, concise and highly reliable has it's payoffs though, since it doesn't just help the human readers,
but it also ensures that docs are structured in such a way that AI models can reliably interpret and communicate accurate information on your behalf.

It's also true that visuals can often communicate more clearly than words alone.
That's why we pair concise explanations with detailed, annotated screenshots and diagrams where needed.

## Conclusion

Switching to a new technology always comes with a learning curve, but this time the learning curve wasn't that steep.

We are more than happy with the decision to switch to Starlight and Astro, but we would like to get your opinion.
