## What are OCI Artifact Registries?

OCI Artifact Registries are services designed to store and manage software artifacts, such as container images, Helm charts, Terraform modules, and other components, used throughout software development and deployment workflows.
These registries support the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) standard, ensuring interoperability and consistency in artifact handling across different systems and environments.

## What is an Artifact in Software?

In computer science, a software artifact (or artefact, both spellings are used, but artifact is more common) refers to any tangible by-product produced during software development or operations.
Examples include container images, compiled binaries, documentation, and infrastructure templates such as Terraform modules.

## Benefits of Using OCI Artifact Registries

OCI Artifact Registries provide several advantages:

- **Secure Images and Minimal Image Footprint:** Registries can store minimal images, such as Chainguard Images or other secure Docker images, optimized to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance container security.
- **Centralized Artifact Management:** By centralizing software artifacts, registries enable efficient version control, reducing complexity when managing deployments, updates, and rollbacks.
- **Enhanced Container Base Security:** By managing artifacts in a dedicated registry, organizations can enforce container image security policies, ensuring that only vetted and secure images are deployed in environments.
- **Usage Tracking and Analytics:** Although usage tracking and analytics aren't standard features in most OCI registries, having the capability to have an audit log for artifact downloads is highly valuable.
Platforms like the Distr registry offer these advanced analytics capabilities.

## How OCI Artifact Registries Enable On-Premises Software Delivery

OCI Artifact Registries significantly simplify software artifact distribution, particularly for on-premises environments:

- **Private Registries for Controlled Deployment:** Organizations leveraging on-premises solutions often require full control over artifact distribution. OCI-compliant private registries ensure artifacts, like Terraform modules from a private Terraform registry or private enterprise Helm charts are securely and privately accessible to authorized environments.
- **Reliable Artifact Supply Chain:** OCI Artifact Registries are key components in building a reliable software artifact supply chain, allowing secure, verified software artifacts to flow seamlessly from development to production environments.
- **Self-Managed Registries:** Organizations requiring single-tenancy or strict compliance benefit from OCI Artifact by hosting their own artifact registry internally, so they can distribute containers withing their network.

## Artifact vs Artefact in Software

While both "artifact" and "artefact" are technically correct, "artifact" is the standard spelling in software and computer science contexts, particularly in American English.
The variant "artefact" is more common in British English but is rarely used in software globally.
In the software industry, "artifact" remains the universally recognized and accepted spelling.

## OCI Registry for Terraform modules

Terraform private registries specifically store Terraform modules, enabling secure sharing and reuse of infrastructure templates within an organization.
OCI Artifact Registries can similarly store Terraform modules alongside container images and other software artifacts, simplifying infrastructure-as-code workflows.

Example:
```bash
tar cvzf my-module.tar.gz my-module/
oras push my-registry.example.com/my-terraform-module:v1.0 \
  --artifact-type application/vnd.hashicorp.terraform.module.v1+tar.gz \
  my-module.tar.gz
```

## OCI Registry for Helm Charts
Helm, the popular package manager for Kubernetes, allows users to store and distribute Helm charts using OCI-compliant artifact registries. OCI support in Helm provides a standardized way to manage and share Helm charts securely across different environments.

Example:
```bash
helm package my-chart/
helm push my-chart-0.1.0.tgz oci://my-registry.example.com/helm-charts
```

## Examples of OCI registries:

Cloud:
 - Docker Hub
 - GitHub Container Registry
 - Chainguard Registry
 - Google Artifact Registry
 - Distr

Self hosted:
 - Harbor
 - JFrog Artifactory
 - Distr
 - Gitea Container Registry

- [Distribution (formely Docker Distribution)](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)

### OCI registry specifications
OCI registry specifications define the standards for storing, distributing, and running containerized applications in a consistent and interoperable way. These specifications ensure compatibility across different registries, runtimes, and container tools, enabling a reliable ecosystem for modern software deployment.

These are the three OCI specifications 
- [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) – Defining how container images should be structured, stored, and transported.
- [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) – Standardizing how container images and artifacts are distributed via OCI-compliant registries.
- [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) – Specifying the low-level execution environment for running OCI-compliant containers.

### OCI registry conformance
OCI registry conformance ensures that a registry has been tested against the [OCI Distribution Specification](#oci-registry-specifications) (there are no conformance tests available for the runtime or image format specs yet), verifying its adherence to OCI standards and ensuring interoperability with OCI-compliant tools.

A conformant registry must support APIs categorized into the following workflow groups:

- **Pull** - Clients are able to pull from the registry
- **Push** - Clients are able to push to the registry
- **Content Discovery** - Clients are able to list or otherwise query the content stored in the registry
- **Content Management** - Clients are able to control the full life-cycle of the content stored in the registry

To be considered an OCI-conformant registry, at minimum, all APIs in the *Pull* category must be supported.

#### Conformance testing
If you are developing a registry and want to verify compliance with these workflow categories, use the [conformance testing tool](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/main/conformance).
