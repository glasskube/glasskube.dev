## What are OCI Artifact Registries?

OCI Artifact Registries are services designed to store and manage software artifacts, such as container images, Helm charts, Terraform modules, and other componentsâ€”used throughout software development and deployment workflows.
These registries support the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard, ensuring interoperability and consistency in artifact handling across different systems and environments.

## What is an Artifact in Software?

In computer science, a software artifact (or artefact, both spellings are used, but artifact is more common) refers to any tangible by-product produced during software development or operations.
Examples include container images, compiled binaries, documentation, and infrastructure templates such as Terraform modules.

## Benefits of Using OCI Artifact Registries

OCI Artifact Registries provide several advantages:

- **Secure Images and Minimal Image Footprint:** Registries can store minimal images, such as Chainguard Images or other secure Docker images, optimized to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance container security.
- **Centralized Artifact Management:** By centralizing software artifacts, registries enable efficient version control, reducing complexity when managing deployments, updates, and rollbacks.
- **Enhanced Container Base Security:** By managing artifacts in a dedicated registry, organizations can enforce container image security policies, ensuring that only vetted and secure images are deployed in environments.
- **Usage Tracking and Analytics:** Although usage tracking and analytics aren't standard features in most OCI registries, having the capability to have an audit log for artifact downloads is highly valuable.
Platforms like the Distr registry offer these advanced analytics capabilities.

## How OCI Artifact Registries Enable On-Premises Software Delivery

OCI Artifact Registries significantly simplify software artifact distribution, particularly for on-premises environments:

- **Private Registries for Controlled Deployment:** Organizations leveraging on-premises solutions often require full control over artifact distribution. OCI-compliant private registries ensure artifacts, like Terraform modules from a private Terraform registry or private enterprise Helm charts are securely and privately accessible to authorized environments.
- **Reliable Artifact Supply Chain:** OCI Artifact Registries are key components in building a reliable software artifact supply chain, allowing secure, verified software artifacts to flow seamlessly from development to production environments.
- **Self-Managed Registries:** Organizations requiring single-tenancy or strict compliance benefit from OCI Artifact by hosting their own artifact registry internally, so they can distribute containers withing their network.

## Artifact vs Artefact in Software

While both "artifact" and "artefact" are technically correct, "artifact" is the standard spelling in software and computer science contexts, particularly in American English.
The variant "artefact" is more common in British English but is rarely used in software globally.
In the software industry, "artifact" remains the universally recognized and accepted spelling.

## OCI Registry for Terraform modules

Terraform private registries specifically store Terraform modules, enabling secure sharing and reuse of infrastructure templates within an organization.
OCI Artifact Registries can similarly store Terraform modules alongside container images and other software artifacts, simplifying infrastructure-as-code workflows.
