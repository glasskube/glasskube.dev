## What is Software License Management?

Software License Management (SLM) refers to the processes, tooling, and systems used by software vendors to control, track, and manage access to software through licenses.
In practice, this means enabling or disabling access to specific versions, features, or software artifacts based on a customer’s entitlement.

It’s a key part of how software is packaged and distributed not just an operational requirement, but a mechanism for delivering differentiated value and reducing adoption friction in on-premises or self-hosted environments.

## Why is Software License Management Important?

- **Control Access to Artifacts or full Applications:** Define which customers can access specific artifacts and artifact versions in a registry or fully packaged applications.
- **Enforce Business Subscription Models:** Support subscription, perpetual, or usage-based models with license enforcement tied to entitlement logic and feature flags.
- **Protect Intellectual Property:** Ensure software is only used according to the license it gets distributed.

## Software License Management in Modern On-Premises Deployments

As more vendors offer software for on-premises, hybrid, and air-gapped environments, license management systems must adapt.
Modern license enforcement goes beyond serial keys or cloud checks, it integrates with how software is packaged and distributed.

In platforms like [Distr](https://distr.sh/docs/guides/license-mgmt/), embed licensing directly into the distribution flow, which not only secures access but also improves transparency and control for both vendor and customer.

## Types of Software License Enforcement

Distr's license management is designed for two different distribution models and customer needs:

- **Application License Enforcement:** Systems designed to manage access to full application or versions of an application.
- **Artifact-Based License Enforcement:** Systems that restrict access to software artifacts in registries or repositories.

Further types include:
- **Feature-Based License Enforcement:** Control access to specific features or capabilities within an application.

## Features of Effective License Management Software

Modern license management systems typically include:

- **Granular Access Control:** Gate access to containers, binaries, Helm charts, release versions, patches, based on entitlements.
- **Enablement Tracking:** Manage and audit what each customer is entitled to and verify if the entitlements are correctly adjudicated.
- **License Expiration:** Automate and control license expiration and renewal processes.
- **Offline License Verification:** Ensure that license checks still work in air-gapped or disconnected environments.

## How to Track Software Licenses Effectively

Effective license tracking involves:

- Using a centralized system to manage license data across customers and deployments
- Automating license assignment and expiration
- Performing regular internal audits
- Ensuring license updates are enforced in real-time
