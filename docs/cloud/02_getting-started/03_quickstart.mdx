# Quickstart

## Prerequisites
Glasskube Cloud is designed to help distribute "on-prem" ready software to customer-controlled environments. The key phrase here is "on-prem ready."

## What does "on-prem ready" mean?

### On-prem ready checklist: 

- Your application is fully containerized (Docker or Helm)
- You are using some sort of consistent versioning 
- If your application has dependencies, these should also be standardized and declared

If you're an ISV who has developed a SaaS product and later been approached by a customer requesting to use your product "on-prem," you’ve likely experienced the challenges of lacking on-prem readiness. Deploying to on-premises, self-hosted, or complex customer-controlled environments requires deliberate decisions and architectural considerations made early in the development process to ensure such deployments are practical.

Software built with on-prem readiness in mind from the start often reflects thoughtful design, focusing on maintainability and configurations suitable for future on-prem use cases. However, many software solutions aren’t initially created with these scenarios in mind. As customer requirements evolve, SaaS products may need adjustments to support on-prem deployments. Ideally, your application should already be containerized, with a Docker Compose file or Helm chart prepared. If not, feel free to reach out for white-glove onboarding assistance.

### What changes are needed for on-prem readiness?

To bridge this gap, we've compiled a document outlining the foundational building blocks for achieving on-prem readiness. You can access this comprehensive whitepaper [here].
