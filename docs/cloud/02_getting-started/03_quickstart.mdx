# Quickstart

## Prerequisites
Glasskube Cloud is designed to help distribute "on-prem" ready software to customer-controlled environments. The key phrase here is "on-prem ready."

## What does "on-prem ready" mean?

### On-prem ready checklist: 

- Your application is fully containerized (Docker or Helm)
- You are using some sort of consistent versioning 
- If your application has dependencies, these should also be standardized and declared

If you're an ISV who has developed a SaaS product and later been approached by a customer requesting to use your product "on-prem," you’ve likely experienced the challenges of lacking on-prem readiness. Deploying to on-premises, self-hosted, or complex customer-controlled environments requires deliberate decisions and architectural considerations made early in the development process to ensure such deployments are practical.

Software built with on-prem readiness in mind from the start often reflects thoughtful design, focusing on maintainability and configurations suitable for future on-prem use cases. However, many software solutions aren’t initially created with these scenarios in mind. As customer requirements evolve, SaaS products may need adjustments to support on-prem deployments. Ideally, your application should already be containerized, with a Docker Compose file or Helm chart prepared. If not, feel free to reach out for white-glove onboarding assistance.

### What changes are needed for on-prem readiness?

To bridge this gap, we've compiled a document outlining the foundational building blocks for achieving on-prem readiness. You can access this comprehensive [whitepaper here](/white-paper/building-blocks/).

## Follow the onboarding wizard to get started

:::warning
The Onboarding Wizard will only appear if your Distr account has not yet created its first application, customer, or deployment. If you’ve already used the Onboarding Wizard but would like to add more applications, customers, or deployments, please follow these [instructions](#onboard-more-applications-customers-and-deployments)
:::

### Onboarding Wizard
The Onboarding Wizard is a step-by-step guide that assists Distr users in uploading an application based on a Docker Compose file or a Helm chart, onboarding a customer if one is available, and adding a deployment that will be installed by the Distr agent.

:::info
The Onboarding Wizard also offers the option to onboard a sample app for testing purposes. To gain a better understanding of how Distr works, we'll begin by onboarding the test app.
:::

![wizard-start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec3023db-abe6-434e-9e28-452f693d3300)

### Let's Onboard a Sample Application

Upon clicking "Continue" on the initial Onboarding Wizard screen, you'll be prompted to choose the type of app definition files you'd like to onboard. Distr users can select either Docker Compose files or Helm charts. Alternatively, you can click the "I don't know yet, please just let me test!" checkbox (shown in the image below) to deploy a sample bookmarking app, which is based on a Docker Compose file.

At this stage, Distr handles the process of locating the app definition file, exposing the application version and preparing it for distribution. 

![test-app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e894d70-247b-4ede-a937-b2e37c1137ed)

### Define Ownership of Target Environment

Next, you'll move to the stage where users are prompted to choose a name and define who is responsible for the target environment where the application will be deployed. Deployment targets can either be managed by the end-customer or directly by the Distr user. At this step, you'll find two checkboxes to choose from:

- **"I Am"**: Select this if you are responsible for and have control over the deployment target, such as for IoT, edge, or internal use cases. 
- **"An employee of the customer"**: Select this when the end-user's team is responsible for managing deployments, and the Distr user does not have access to the deployment target. More suited towards On-prem and end-customer hosted use cases.

![define-owner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a890ed82-05b4-4a83-ba4b-94c6aa51435c)

:::info
Once you click "Continue," Distr will create a deployment named "Test-Customer." Since the target deployment environment hasn't been connected yet, the deployment status will appear in the gray "initial" stage. To complete the process and make the deployment of our test app healthy, we'll need to connect the target environment to Distr.
:::

Deployment with status: *initial*
![deployment-check](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84437f8d-31e1-419c-899b-b714610e9a0c)

### Connect the Target Environment with the Dirstr Agent

To complete the final step and connect the target environment to Distr, you'll need to access the target environment and run the curl command displayed in the Onboarding Wizard console. In this test case, the agent will be installed in a local Docker Desktop environment. So make sure to have access to a local Docker desktop instance. 

Once the agent is installed, it will pull the deployment specifications and install the deployment into the target environment. After installation, the agent will communicate with the Distr hub to confirm that the deployment is up and running. This will update the status on the deployment page to *"OK."*
![run-agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e85094b-f596-458b-8883-614bd5888347)


Run the Distr agent in the target environment:
![run-agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a155889a-07b3-4ef0-af00-18895c78a78a)

### The Test Deployment is Operational

Check in the "Deployments" tab, to see if the test deployments health is *green*.

Deployment with status: *OK*
![agent-up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b68c78d6-2508-4ba4-a885-bb0109418c7a)

As mentioned earlier, the test bookmarking app is packaged in a Docker Compose file and runs locally on Docker Desktop. You can verify the deployment by checking the running Docker containers.

To do this, run the command `docker ps` to view the active containers in your Docker environment.

Here's what you'll find:

1. The Distr (glasskube) agent was installed first.
2. The agent then deployed two additional containers:
    - The Shiori app
    - The Shiori app's database container

![docker-ps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3279b486-2a7b-4931-ba55-cb0bfc6f7227)

You can also navigate to the main Dashboard page, where the widgets will update to display the latest uptime and deployment metrics currently available.

![dashboard-view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df040ff8-c7bc-4309-962f-9ef4c33cddb3)

## Onboard more applications, customers and deployments.

Distr users will only see the Onboarding Wizard once, and only if no applications have been onboarded. After completing the onboarding process by adding their first application, customer, and running the first deployment, all of these steps can be repeated individually as needed.
### Add another application

Head over to the `Applications` tab and on the top right corner click on the `+ Add Application` button. And simply follow the steps.

![add-application](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10b46258-6966-4178-909c-861ea83162fe)

### Invite more customer
Head over to the `Customers` tab and on the top right corner click on the `+ Invite customer` button. And simply follow the steps. 

![invite-customer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa362f6-16bc-4e3b-9bed-cbcbe53add02)
### Add more deployments

Head over to the `Deployments` tab and click on the `+ Add deployment` button and follow the steps.
