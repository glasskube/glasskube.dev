# What is Glasskube Cloud?

Glasskube Cloud is an open-core commercial software distribution platform designed for Independent Software Vendors ISVs. It supports ISVs in delivering their software solutions to end customers operating in complex, customer-controlled environments. These environments feature diverse deployment configurations, including on-premises, self-hosted, Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), air-gapped systems, and private clouds.

The platform is also designed to support ISVs operating edge locations or devices where they control the infrastructure. Glasskube Cloud was developed in response to the increasing number of ISVs managing forward-deployed environments and devices, where traditional deployment and management tools fell short. The platform delivers the same robust features ISVs rely on for on-prem customers but tailored to meet the unique challenges of their complex edge locations.

Glasskube cloud is built on a hub and spoke model where ISV can have a centralized view of all of their dispersed customer or internal deployments. The centralized control plane can be accessed via the GUI, API of SDK. 

The platform aims to deliver features that aid in the delivery, management and licensing of [“on-premises“ ready](http://localhost:3000/white-paper/building-blocks/) applications. 

### Here are some of the main value propositions Glasskube cloud brings to ISVs: 

- Increased customer onboarding velocity
- Frictionless application updates
- Centralized application uptime monitoring
- Software license management
- Support for Docker compose and Helm charts
- Control over internally deployed applications
- BYOC mode for deployments to ISV controlled environments
- Increased troubleshooting speed and effectiveness
