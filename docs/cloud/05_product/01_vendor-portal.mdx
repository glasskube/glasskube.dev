# Vendor Portal

The Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Portal is the primary interface for interacting with the Distr hub.

Since Distr is a platform specifically built for ISVs, the vendor portal serves as the gateway to access all Distr features. In contrast, the [Customer Portal](/products/cloud/docs/product/customer-portal/) is a simplified version of the vendor portal, designed to provide end-customers with the ability to configure and control their distributions.

The vendor portal offers: 

1. A main dashboard featuring uptime metrics, graphs, and table widgets to monitor and manage applications and deployments.
2.The `"Applications"` tab, where users can add multiple applications and host multiple versions simultaneously, allowing end customers to deploy different versions as needed.
3. The `"Customers"` tab, for managing customer information.
4. Deployment management, to oversee and control internally deployed applications.
5. A section to manage the users on your team.
6. A light/dark mode toggle button.
7. An account setting section.
