  <summary>Can I toggle between Vendor and Customer portal?</summary>
  <p> No, there is no way to toggle between the Vendor and Customer views. If a vendor wants to manage their own deployments, they can do so using the Deployments tab within the Vendor Portal. The Customer Portal is only accessible to end-customers who have been onboarded by an ISV. After onboarding, the customer will receive an email to set their credentials. Once the credentials are set, the end-customer can access the Customer Portal. </p>
